# MDX  Markdown with JSX support

JSX is the format for React Components. MDX is markdown with with additional support for react components. This lets docusaurus do all sorts of neat things. 

## Partials

One of the most useful things is partials, which are markdown files that can be imported into `.mdx` files. These partials can even accept props for greater reusability. 

putting this in our markdown file: 

```
<Demo version="1" />
<Demo version="2" />
<PartialExample name="Matt" />
<PartialExample name="Lisa" />
```

results in:
<Demo version="1" />
<Demo version="2" /> 
<PartialExample name="Matt" />
<PartialExample name="Lisa" />

This feature lets Docusaurus be very flexible and prevent lots of formatting. All the images below use the same react component with different props for easy image formatting.

<MdImage justify="center" source="/static/img/docusaurus.png" alt="logo" />
<MdImage justify="left" source="/static/img/docusaurus.png" alt="logo" />
<MdImage justify="right" source="/static/img/docusaurus.png" alt="logo" />
