# Editing the Docs

## Access

Edit access is managed through source control. Anyone allowed to contribute to the git repo can view and publish to the docs. 

## Drafting Local

In general most people will be expected to clone the repo and work locally. 

By cloning the project they'll be able to get a preview of their output by running a local server. This is as effective as most markdown editors in providing a preview. 

We also expect the bulk of our contributors to be developers so this should be familiar.

## Reviewing

Feedback can be given on a per line basis in github as either feedback or suggstions and several branches can be going at a time. 

## Publishing

Every time a branch is merged into `main` the static site generator should kick off the build process. No need to schedule builds as changes can be bundled at the branch level then merged in group.
